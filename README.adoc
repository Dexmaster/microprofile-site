== Live application

Checkout the live application here: https://microprofile.io/


== Summary
Since the middle of 2018, this project is used just to provide a REST API used by WP Engine to render the following pages:

* https://microprofile.io/projects/
* https://microprofile.io/contributors/

The following diagram shows the relationship between Amazon ELB (the one hosting this project), Cloudflare and WP Engine.

== How to build and run the application locally?

Simply run `mvn clean install tomee:run`. Your server will be available at
http://localhost:8080/

If you want to the GitHub integration to work, you will need a microprofile github access token,
(link:https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens[Documentation on how to do this]). Set the
`microprofile_github_atoken` value in `src/main/resources/base.properties`.  When you generate that token Github will
present you with a list of 20+ possible permissions.  No special permission required.

If you are making changes to the https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-site-config[microprofile.io]
configuration repo, you can test that by having your local copy point to your forked version where the changes live.
Simply edit `src/main/resources/base.properties` and change the default
`microprofile_config_root=microprofile/microprofile.io` to the individual's repo who filed the `microprofile.io` pull
request.  For example `microprofile_config_root=ivannov/microprofile.io` is how you would point to
https://github.com/ivannov/microprofile.io

=== Example of `src/main/resources/base.properties`

----
microprofile_blog_root=microprofile/microprofile-blog
microprofile_config_root=microprofile/microprofile-site-config
microprofile_github_atoken=<your token here>
----

== Node.js and Gulp (deprecated)

This application heavily depends on link:https://nodejs.org/[node.js] and link:http://gulpjs.com/[gulp] to build all the
static resources. These tools will execute tons of actions not yet available in the java world; at least not as handy
as available on node.js. The good news is that we don't need to worry about a thing. It will feel like any regular
maven project. `mvn clean install tomee:run` will perform all the heavy lifting. It downloads the dependencies
and executes node.js, gulp and the tomee server.

== What about front-end development? (deprecated)

Front-end developers don't need to restart servers. In fact, front-end developers don't like to waste a single second
waiting for a JS change to be reflected on a web application. This is what make web development fun.

Our application uses
link:http://jade-lang.com/[Jade],
link:http://sass-lang.com/[Sass],
link:https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer[Autoprefixer],
link:https://github.com/sprity/sprity[Sprity],
link:http://bower.io/[Bower],
link:https://github.com/karimsa/gulp-jslint[JsLint],
link:https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify[UglifyJs],
link:https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps[SourceMaps]. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do before making a
static change visible in the web site.

In order to make it automatic, run `mvn frontend:gulp` in another terminal. It will trigger the default gulp task,
which will watch for changes on *src/main/static/* and updates the running tomee instance accordingly as soon as a
static change is detected.

== Unit testing (deprecated)

We have two types of tests: backend and frontend. The frontend testing
is somewhat special because it uses link:http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html[karma]. It's transparent for
the devepolers because both tests are triggered by the same `mvn clean install`.

Sometimes we are interested on frontend testing only. We can do it by executing 'mvn frontend:karma'.

When you execute `mvn frontend:karma`, a browser window will popup.

== How to publish content? (deprecated)

Some of the content of this application is based on another Github project:
link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-site-config[].
In order to publish a new project, simply add a new line in
link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile-site-config/blob/master/site.yaml[site.yaml].
The changes will be live after 5 minutes.

== Production Architecture

=== Summary
Clouldflare sits in front of our website as a CDN and proxy. By setting our NS records to point at Cloudflare, Clouldflare automagically handles content distribution around the world by scraping our website. If Cloudflare cannot handle the request, it will hand the request off to the Amazon ELB. The Amazon ELB points at EC2 instances created by an autoscaling group. The isntances are running the Amazon Beanstalk Agent. The autoscaling group maintains a minimum of 1 instance. If the autoscaling group notices the servers are too busy, it'll add instances. When a new instance is launched, the Amazon Beanstalk Agent on the instance notifies the Beanstalk Cluster that it's available to take a task. The Beanstalk Cluster will then deploy the new zip file to the instance, and notify the ELB to start sending traffic to the new instance. The ELB will start sending traffic to the new instance once the instance begins passing health checks.

=== Cloudflare CDN



==== DNS
        microprofile.io → WP engine
        api.microprofile.io → amazon ELB

==== HTTP
```
[User Agent] -HTTP Request-> [Cloudflare HTTP Servers]
If static asset:
[User Agent] <-HTTP Response- [Cloudflare Cache server]
If non-static asset:
[User Agent] <-HTTP Response- [Cloudflare Proxy server] <-HTTP Response- [Amazon Elastic Load Balancer]
```

==== Amazon Architecture
```
[Elastic Load Balancer] |-> [Active Instances Subnet0] -> [JVM Instance]
                        |-> [Active Instances Subnet1] -> [JVM Instance]
```

=== WP Engine
WP engine is the one hosting 99% of all the pages. The only pages not developed on WP engine are the ones who's
content comes from the Amazon ELB API:

* /contributors
* /projects

WP engine has the following redirection rules for the dynamic js pages described above:

* /project/.+
* /api/(.*)$

== Deployment

The deploy process creates a zip file which has the executable jar, and bundles several AWS config files.

== Prerequisites

* Request an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the Microprofile account.
* Request the GitHub token.

=== Setup

* You should install the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[AWS CLI] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html[AWS EB CLI] using your package manager. 
* Setup the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html[AWS Credentials] in your `.aws` directory and make sure to use the region `us-west-2`
* Clone the source for this project to your local drive and cd to that directory.

Run the command:

```
$ mvn clean package
```
Note: this takes a while to run and may appear to hang, but it is actually working.

Test your credentials by issuing this command:
```
$ eb list
```

If everything worked correctly, you should see:
```
microprofile-io-env
```

=== Build and deploy manually

**Note**
Before running this command, one should make sure `microprofile_github_atoken` in `src/main/resources/base.properties` is set to a production value, or should override it using one of the ways afforded by the Sabot project.

`mvn clean package tomee:exec assembly:single && eb deploy microprofile-io-env`

**Note**
If the contributors page is broken, it's likely because you did not set the `microprofile_github_atoken`. Remember to flush cloudflare cache to view the website changes.

=== Config file descriptions (deprecated)

`src/main/config/haproxy.cfg`

This is a simple HAProxy installation that redirects `www.microprofile.io` to `microprofile.io` This is running on an independent instance in AWS.

`src/main/config/ebextensions`

This directory is filtered and copied to `/.ebextensions` in the root of the assembled ZIP archive. It is not part of the JAR. These files configure the Elastic Beanstalk cluster.

`src/main/config/elasticbeanstalk`

This directory is filtered and copied to `.elasticbeanstalk` in the root the maven project. It is not part of the JAR nor the ZIP. These files configure the deployment process to Elastic Beanstalk.

`src/main/config/ziproot`

This directory is filtered and copied to `/` in the root of the assembled ZIP archive.

* `Procfile` tells the AWS Agent what command to run to launch your deployment. It launches the next script:
* `kill-before-run.sh` ensures that all existing Java processes have been terminated before launching the new Java archive. This is sort of a hack, if someone has a better way to do this, it'd be much appreciated.

== Creating a new html page (deprecated)

----

You will need to add a new route entry with the `.when('/new_page', {...}` line, include the new page in the menu with
`a(href="new_page") New Page` and add the new page (Example: `/src/main/static/assets/templates/page_new_page.jade`).

For the styles, make sure you can identify the parts you want to apply new styles with a easy css selector. In the case
above we use `div.page-body.new_page` as we used it in our new `page_new_page.jade` code. Create a new `sass` file
(Example: `/src/main/static/assets/styles/page_new_page.sass`) and include it as `@import` in the main `app.sass` file.
